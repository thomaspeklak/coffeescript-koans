# CoffeeScript Koans - koans to learn CoffeeScript #

This work is based on Ben Hall's [Javascript Koans](https://github.com/BenHall/javascript-koans), 
which in turn are based upon Edgecase's [Ruby koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans). 
The goal of the CoffeeScript koans is to teach you CoffeeScript programming through testing.

This is heavily based on (sleepyfox / coffeescript-koans)[https://github.com/sleepyfox/coffeescript-koans]. In contrast to sleepyfox's version this version is only run in the terminal. No browser is needed.

### Installation

1) Fork and/or clone the repository.
2) Run `npm install`

###Run the tests

Run `coffee start.coffee`

If you have not installed CoffeeScript you can run `node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee start.coffee`
